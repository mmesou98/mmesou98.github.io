                            <h2>MY STORY</h2>
                            <p>I am Mmesoma Mary Nnaoma. I'm 19 going on 20.                           
                            Number 5 amongst 7 children (yeah, seven children, lol).</p> 
                            
                            <p>I love to eat No matter how emotional I get, I never forget or joke with my food. Now, dont get it twisted. I don't eat too much, but I just don't joke with my meals.</p>
                            
                            <p>I sing, I'm a chorister in my church choir.  And I dance too. </p>
                            
                            <p>I so love to skip. I mean the skipping rope thingy. Or, let me rather say I love to jump ropes.</p>
                            
                            <p>I draw sometimes, act sometimes too (with myself alone, hehe).</p>
                            
                            <p>I write so many times; I have lots of short stories, essays, written thoughts on my scrapbooks that only I, a few friends and my family members have read; many of which I have even lost.</p>
                            
                            <p>I read lots of books too; how else would I know how to write?</p>
                            
                            <p>Most of all, I love always;both God and man.</p>
                            
                            <p>I have done some hand-made crafts. Neck piece, wristbands, bags, etc; all from my innate talent and imagination; never had to learn them from anywhere. I guess I just have gifted hands; hehehe, I suppose I'm allowed to gloat on my own website.</p>
                            
                            <p>And yeah, lest I forget, I talk alot sometimes, but that after I've come to know you well and feel super comfortable around you because I'm super introvert.</p>
                            
                            <p>Phew!! You know so much about me already. Now to the mundane stuffs.</p>
                            
                            <p>Well in the year 2009, I graduated from Ojodu Primary School II.
                            In 2012, I graduated from Ojodu Junior High School II.
                            And in 2015, I graduated fron Babs Fafunwa Millenium Senior Grammar School, from science class. And till this time, like most my age and similar profile, I had only wanted be a medical doctor and nothing more.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm an active person evident in my crafts and multi-tasking. I had only waited for JAMB and opportunity for higher institution till April 2016 when I joined Digital Systems Connectivities Services; a financial e-channel services provider to banks and other financial institutions as an office assistant. And that's where and when my new quest to be tech savvy was born. </p>
                            
                            <p>NOW, merging my aspirations, I dream night and day (yes, I close my eye everyday and see myself in this state) and see myself celebrated as the medical doctor who developed a technological ecosystem that simplifies and makes affordable quality health care services in Nigeria. I don't know how I would achieve this, but I know one thing. </p>
                            
                            <p>I MUST TRY!</p>
